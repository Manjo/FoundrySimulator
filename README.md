Misc Files:
----

A current batch of images can be downloaded at http://www.mrmanjo.com/downloads/foundryimages.rar

JQueryTools library can be found at http://jquerytools.org/download/

To-do: 
-----

- Reformat the items into a seperate JSON file - Eventually I would like to pull items from rails database, this is one of the first steps in preparing for this.

- Code a less intensive way of repopulating the shop - Currently it just reloads all images as if it was being reinitialized, could be done more gracefully.
